# Construction_Safety_BTP

This project is a real-time safety monitoring backend that detects PPE compliance and unsafe postures of construction workers using computer vision models.  
It combines **YOLO** for PPE detection, **MediaPipe** for pose estimation, and ergonomic analysis (RULA/REBA) for posture risk evaluation.
